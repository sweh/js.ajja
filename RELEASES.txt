  ``fullrelease``)
* Checkout shim repository for release on bower: ``github.com:gocept/gocept.jsform.git``.
* Copy all files from ``src/gocept/jsform/resources/`` into shim repository.
* Remove ``handlebars.js`` and ``handlebars.min.js`` from shim repository. It is only needed for fanstatic version as js.handlebars is outdated.
